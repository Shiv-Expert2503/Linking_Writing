# Problem Statement
Itâ€™s difficult to summarize the complex set of behavioral actions and cognitive activities in the writing process. Writers may use different techniques to plan and revise their work, demonstrate distinct pause patterns, or allocate time strategically throughout the writing process. Many of these small actions may influence writing quality. Even so, most writing assessments focus on only the final product. Data science may be able to uncover key aspects of the writing process.
My goal for this project is to predict overall writing quality. Does typing behavior affect the outcome of an essay? I have developed a model trained on a large dataset of keystroke logs that have captured writing process features.
